# Debite
This is my personal startup script to automate much of the process, most of the tedious stuff. This is originally made for Debian Bookworm. Should work on most deb based distros but obviously may not work on all.

## Themes
I've included the items I installed as themes and the tar files I downloaded and used. This is purely for my own convenience.

Window Manager theme: Flat-Remix-Dark-XFWM
Theme: Flat-Remix-GTK-Blue-Dark
Icons: Papirus-Dark
Terminal: xfce4 terminal with "Dark Pastels" color preset and 95% opacity
